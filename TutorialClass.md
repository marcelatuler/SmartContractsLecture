Tutorial Class: Introduction to Smart Contracts with Remix IDE

#### Class Objective:
Students will learn how to create, compile, and deploy two Solidity smart contracts using the Remix IDE. The first contract will generate a token with a digitally signed payload, and the second contract will verify digital signatures against a list of members.

Prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of blockchain and Ethereum.
- Some familiarity with programming (preferably in JavaScript or a C-like language).

Tools Needed:
- Web browser with access to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Part 1: Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Introduction to Remix IDE:
   - Navigate to Remix IDE in your web browser
   - Overview of the Remix IDE interface (File explorers, code editor, compile tab, deploy & run tab)

2. Creating a New File:
   - Create a new file in Remix with the `.sol` extension for Solidity.
   - Explain the Solidity version pragma.

Part 2: Writing the Token Generation Contract
1. Defining the Contract:
   - Begin by writing the contract declaration.
   ```solidity
   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

   contract TokenGenerator {
       // Contract code will go here
   }
   ```
